## Development

Make sure you have installed Grunt, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

### Building the site

At first, run `npm install` command in the project's root directory to install all dependencies described in [`package.json`](./package.json).

To build the site and run it in a server, run `grunt` command. Then the [Grunt tasks](./Gruntfile.coffee) generate the `master` directory which contains compiled files, and you can view the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
